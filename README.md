   - C-level (CTO, CEO, CIO): +25 points
   - VP/Head of: +20 points
   - Director: +15 points
   - Manager: +10 points
3. **Company Size Bonus**:
   - 501-1000: +15 points
   - 201-500: +12 points
   - 101-200: +10 points
   - 51-200: +8 points
   - 11-50: +5 points
4. **Funding Stage Bonus**:
   - Series C: +15 points
   - Series B: +12 points
   - Series A: +10 points
   - Seed: +5 points
5. **Email Validity**: +10 points

Final score is capped at 100.
