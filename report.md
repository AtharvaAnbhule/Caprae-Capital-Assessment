## Design Choices

### Architecture Decisions

#### 1. Technology Stack Selection
**Frontend: React + TypeScript + Vite**
- React provides a component-based architecture for maintainable UI development
- TypeScript adds type safety, reducing bugs and improving developer experience
- Vite offers lightning-fast development and optimized production builds

**Backend: Python + Flask**

**Styling: Tailwind CSS**
- Utility-first approach enables rapid UI development
- Consistent design system out of the box
- Small bundle size with purging unused styles

#### 2. Lead Scoring Algorithm
The scoring system was designed to reflect real-world B2B sales priorities:

**Multi-Factor Evaluation**
- Role seniority: Decision-makers (C-level, VPs) receive higher scores
- Company size: Larger companies often have bigger budgets
- Funding stage: Well-funded companies can afford premium solutions
- Email validity: Ensures sales team can actually reach the contact
- Engagement score: Historical interaction data influences final score

**Why This Matters**
Sales teams waste 50% of their time on unqualified leads. By automatically scoring leads, the tool helps prioritize outreach to the most promising prospects, potentially doubling conversion rates.

#### 3. Filtering System Design
The multi-dimensional filtering system addresses common sales challenges:

**Technology Stack Filter**
- Identifies companies using specific technologies
- Enables targeted pitches based on tech compatibility
- Example: Filter for "React" to pitch React component libraries

**Location Filter**
- Supports geographical targeting strategies
- Helps with timezone-aware outreach scheduling
- Enables regional sales territory management

**Company Size & Role Filters**
- Ensures alignment with Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)
- Prevents wasted outreach to wrong decision-makers
- Focuses effort on companies matching product market fit

**Minimum Score Filter**
- Allows focus on high-priority leads only
- Enables segmented campaigns (high-score: phone calls, low-score: email drip)

#### 4. Data Model
The lead data structure captures essential B2B information:

```typescript
interface Lead {
  company: string;           // Organization name
  contact_name: string;      // Decision-maker name
  email: string;             // Validated contact email
  role: string;              // Job title/seniority
  company_size: string;      // Employee count range
  location: string;          // Geographic location
  tech_stack: string[];      // Technologies used
  industry: string;          // Market segment
  funding_stage: string;     // Investment maturity
  engagement_score: number;  // Historical engagement
  email_valid: boolean;      // Email validation status
  linkedin_url: string;      // Social profile for research
  last_activity: string;     // Recency indicator
}
```

This structure balances comprehensiveness with usability, providing sales teams with the context needed for personalized outreach.
